# Final Project: Konya Badsa, Lina Cook, Prerana Hiriyur

### Overview

Our project includes a set of apps on 6 statistical topics that newly admitted A3SR students are expected to have a fundamental understanding about.

Currently, incoming students are tested on these topics through a competency test offered in a written format. We have created these apps hoping to add more interactivity to the current format. The apps can also serve as a refresher on these concepts for students taking the test. Additionally, the apps can also equip instructors of introductory courses with interactive tools to teach these topics.

The 6 statistical topics are listed below:

- Summary Statistics: Calculate basic summary statistics of a set of numbers by hand, primarily mean and variance
- Normal distribution: Calculate probabilities, quantiles, and z-scores given information about a normal distribution.
- Central Limit Theorem: Visualize sampling distributions and understand when the central limit theorem holds true
- Hypothesis Testing: Understand what a T-test is (one-sided or two sided) and how to calculate related statistics.
- Confidence Intervals: Calculate and interpret a confidence interval based on the formula.
- Regression: Review the linear regression assumptions and how to diagnose violations.

### Problem

The current format of the test and content is not engaging and does not set a potential student up for success. We believe using interactive apps to refresh core concepts and then testing students is a better approach.

Further, core statistical concepts like hypothesis testing and central limit theorem are often taught using daunting mathematical expressions and terminology. We believe that our apps offer instructors the opportunity to visualize and demonstrate these concepts more effectively.

### End user

Our end users come from 2 categories:
- Incoming A3SR students in need of a quick stats refresher before the competency test.
- Instructors of introductory statistics courses who wish to demonstrate fundamental concepts using visualizations and interactive apps.
